jQuery keepInWindow ist a jQuery plugin which allows you to keep some elements always in the viewport.

Usage is as simple as: $(".elements").keepinwindow();

If the cursor is over the element and the element has a greater height than the window it won't move.

See the examples folder for examples ;)
